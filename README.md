# Selfvoting constant
As you may know, the proof-of-brain is the core of Steemit, you need to proof that you have knowledge, that you are intelligent, that you have brain in order to receive rewards. And you prove that contributing with something valuable. This is what makes STEEM valuable despite its inflation.

**Is it possible to cheat the system and be rewarded without proof-of-brain? One of the ways is the Selfvoting in its maximum expression**. I'm not telling about the selfvote after the publication of a well elaborated post, but the abuse of selfvoting. For instance, suppose a BOT that publish posts with no important content (posts like "Hi I'm a bot. End") and upvotes himself. 

## How profitable is it?
